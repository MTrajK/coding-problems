//a fixed point is basically that index in which a[i]=i 
// so you will be given a sorted array in an ascending array 
//and you have to find the fixed point if any

// two solve this we can do linear search through out the array
//findinf if a[i]==i

//to improve this method we can apply binary search instead of the
//linear search
