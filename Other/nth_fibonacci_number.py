Find Nth Fibonacci Number

The Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence.
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144...
Given a number n, print n-th Fibonacci Number.

Input: 8
Output: 34

=========================================
Many solutions for this problem exist, I'll show 7 different solutions,
starting from the worst, O(2^N) time complexity, and finishg with the best, O(LogN) time complexity.

The simplest recursive solution. Direct recursive implementation of this
mathematical recurrence relation T(N) = T(N-1) + T(N-2).
Everyone knows this, this is the introductory lesson in recursion.
    Time Complexity:    O(2^N)  , actually ~1.6^N, the golden ratio number
    Space Complexity:   O(N)    , because of the recursion stack

Recursion with memoization, much faster, less computations.
For many numbers the recursive function is called more than once (in total ~1.6^N - N times duplicate calls).
Use hashmap/dictionary to save all computed numbers as values and the positions as keys.
    Time Complexity:    O(N)
    Space Complexity:   O(N)

Dynamic programming. Implementation of T(N) = T(N-1) + T(N-2) using a loop and dp table/array.
    Time Complexity:    O(N)
    Space Complexity:   O(N)

Space optimized dynamic programming. You can easily notice that you don't need the whole array,
you need only the last 2 values T(N-1) and T(N-2), and after you compute T(N) you won't need T(N-2) anymore, etc.
    Time Complexity:    O(N)
    Space Complexity:   O(1)

Using power of the matrix [[1, 1], [1, 0]]. The 3 next solutions are based on this logic.
Explanation:
start matrix:   | 1  1 |
                | 1  0 |

result matrix:  | Fn+1  Fn   |
                | Fn    Fn-1 |

result * start =    | Fn+1 * 1 + Fn * 1    Fn+1 * 1 + Fn * 0 |
                    | Fn * 1 + Fn-1 * 1    Fn * 1 + Fn-1 * 0 |

               =    | Fn+1 + Fn    Fn+1 |
                    | Fn + Fn-1    Fn   |

               =    | Fn+2    Fn+1 |
                    | Fn+1    Fn   |
According to this, when you're multiplying with this matrix you're getting the next fibonacci number.
    Time Complexity:    O(N)
    Space Complexity:   O(1)

Time optimized matrix power. Using a recursive divide and conquer approach.
From the basic math we know that A^K * A^K = A^2K, the same rule we can use in matrix multiplication.
    Time Complexity:    O(LogN)
    Space Complexity:   O(LogN)     , because of the recursion stack

Time and space optimized matrix multiplication.
Using a loop (without a recursion) compute the power of N of the matrix.
    Time Complexity:    O(LogN)
    Space Complexity:   O(1)
