# `15` **Longest Increasing Subarray**

# :pencil: Instructions:
Find the longest increasing subarray (subarray is when all elements are neighboring in the original array).
### Expected Result:         

```py
Input: [10, 1, 3, 8, 2, 0, 5, 7, 12, 3]
Output: 4
```
# :bulb: Hint:
Only in one iteration, check if the current element is bigger than the previous and increase the counter if true.
