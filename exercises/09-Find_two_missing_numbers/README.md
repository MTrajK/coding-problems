# **`09` Find two missing numbers in a sequence**

# :pencil: Instructions:
All numbers are integers and they're smaller or equal to the length of the array.
Searching for 2 unknowns, math problem.
This solution is extension of 'find_one_missing_number.py'.
But in this case we also need the sum formula for the first squared N numbers (1^2 + 2^2 + ... + N^2).
And using those 2 formulas, we'll solve equations with 2 unknowns.


### Expected Result:          

```py
Input: [2, 1, 4]
Output: [3, 5]
```
